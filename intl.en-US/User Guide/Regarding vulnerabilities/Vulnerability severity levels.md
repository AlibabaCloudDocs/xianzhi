# Vulnerability severity levels {#concept_oj1_rry_wdb .concept}

This article introduces vulnerability severity levels.

## Rewards program {#section_w5r_rry_wdb .section}

-   We recommend that you set the reward factor to at least 5 to attract more white hats exploring for vulnerabilities.
-   We recommend that you set up a tiered reward factor to encourage white hats to focus more on critical vulnerabilities.

For example, you can establish the following reward program:

## Vulnerability severity levels {#section_z5r_rry_wdb .section}

The vulnerabilities are categorized into three levels based on severity: high, medium, and low. The Crowdsourced Security Testing platform factors in the severity and difficulty of the vulnerabilities to assign a value and severity level to each vulnerability.

The scoring guide of vulnerability severities and types of vulnerabilities are as follows:

**High level risks**

Base score: 60-100. High level vulnerabilities include:

-   Vulnerabilities that directly obtain system access \(server access and PC client access\). They include remote command execution, arbitrary code execution, WebShell upload, SQL injection for system access, and buffer overflow \(including ActiveX buffer overflow\).

-   Vulnerabilities that directly result in the denial of service for mobile gateways, APIs, and web applications.

-   Vulnerabilities that leak sensitive information, including SQL injection for key business databases and interface vulnerabilities that can obtain a large amount of key business data.

-   Severe logical design and process loopholes. They include vulnerabilities that allow mass modification of account password, and logical vulnerabilities that compromise the company's key business.

-   Unauthorized access to sensitive information. This includes bypassing authentication to access the backend, weak backend password, and server side request forgery \(SSRF\) that obtains a large amount of intranet sensitive information.

-   Unauthorized operations in the company's key business. They include unauthorized modification of key information, and modification of key business configuration.

-   Vulnerabilities that affect a large number of users. For example, stored cross-site scripting \(XSS\) vulnerabilities \(and stored DOM-XSS vulnerabilities\) on key webpages, which may spread automatically.


**Medium level risks**

Base score: 30-50. Medium level vulnerabilities include:

-   Vulnerabilities that affect users. They include stored cross-site scripting \(XSS\) vulnerabilities on webpages and cross-site request forgery \(CSRF\) in key businesses.

-   General unauthorized operations, including bypassing restrictions to modify user information and execution of user operations.

-   General logical design and process flaws, including unlimited text messages and registration using any phone number and email.


**Low level risks**

Base score: 10-20. The reward factor can be set to zero. Low level vulnerabilities include:

-   Local denial-of-service vulnerabilities, including local denial-of-service vulnerabilities on the client \(exceptions that occur during the parsing of file formats and network protocols\), and issues related to Android component access exposure and general application access.

-   General information leakage, including clear text passwords on the client, web path traversal, and system path traversal.

-   Other low-risk vulnerabilities, including reflected cross-site scripting \(XSS\) vulnerabilities \(and reflected DOM-XSS vulnerabilities\), general cross-site request forgery \(CSRF\), and URL redirection vulnerabilities.
