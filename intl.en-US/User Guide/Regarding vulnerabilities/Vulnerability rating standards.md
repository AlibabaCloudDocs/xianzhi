# Vulnerability rating standards {#concept_dt1_g5y_wdb .concept}

This article introduces vulnerability rating standards.

## General rules for rating standards {#section_gfl_h5y_wdb .section}

1.  The rules are only applicable to enterprises that have registered with the Crowdsourced Security Testing platform. They only pertain to products and services for which the company explicitly agree to receive the vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities not on the acceptance list of the enterprise are rejected. If you make any adjustment to the severity levels, the new levels take effect. For vulnerabilities in your peripheral business, the severity levels are decreased based on the importance of the peripheral business.

2.  The contribution of white hat professionals for exploring vulnerabilities is determined by factors such as level of exploitation difficulty and scope of vulnerability impact. If the vulnerability is only triggered in rare cases, including but not limited to cross-site scripting \(XSS\) vulnerabilities in certain browsers, then the contribution will be lowered accordingly.

3.  Multiple vulnerabilities resulting from a single vulnerability source are counted as one vulnerability. Examples include: The same interface can cause multiple security vulnerabilities. The same distribution system can cause vulnerabilities on multiple pages. Inappropriate frameworks can cause site-wide vulnerabilities. Wildcard domain name resolution can cause multiple vulnerabilities.

4.  The platform only honors the contribution of the first professional who reports the vulnerabilities in third-party products. The level of vulnerability is no higher than "Medium." Examples include: WordPress and Flash plug-ins, server-side components such as Apache, OpenSSL, and third-party SDKs. Vulnerabilities in different versions of the third-party products are considered one vulnerability.

5.  For a single vulnerability, the platform only honors the contribution of the first professional who reports it.

6.  Before the vulnerability is resolved, the disclosed vulnerabilities do not count toward contribution.

7.  Reporting vulnerabilities that are already disclosed does not count toward contribution.

8.  For multiple vulnerabilities in the same report, only the vulnerability with the highest severity level counts toward contribution.

9.  The platform does not honor any contribution for the following behaviors: Undermining customer interests by exploiting vulnerabilities, hindering business operations, or stealing user data. Additionally, the Crowdsourced Security Testing platform reserves the right to work with registered enterprises to pursue legal actions against such behaviors.


## Resolving disputes {#section_qrn_j5y_wdb .section}

If the white hat professional disputes the vulnerability review process, vulnerability rating or scoring, they can contact the Crowdsourced Security Testing support team. The Crowdsourced Security Testing support team can be contacted through live messaging service, or through commenting on the vulnerability details page. The Crowdsourced Security Testing platform puts the interest of the reporting professional first. It deals with the issue with both the reporting professional and the enterprise. When necessary, external security personnel will be enlisted to help judge the case.
