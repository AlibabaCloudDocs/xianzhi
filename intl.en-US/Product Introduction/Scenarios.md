This article describes the use cases of the Crowdsourced Security Testing platform.

When vulnerabilities on your site are exposed by other platforms, your reputation is at risk, along with a high potential for financial losses. Therefore, you need to build a system to identify and resolve vulnerabilities. Without a robust security program, external white hat professionals may report your vulnerabilities to other platforms and put your business at risk.

After you register with the Crowdsourced Security Testing platform, you can independently launch a rewards program to attract white hat professionals to report vulnerabilities. The platform does not disclose the details of your business vulnerabilities to entities outside your authorized security team.
