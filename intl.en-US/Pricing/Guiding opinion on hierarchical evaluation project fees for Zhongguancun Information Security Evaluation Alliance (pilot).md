# Guiding opinion on hierarchical evaluation project fees for Zhongguancun Information Security Evaluation Alliance \(pilot\) {#concept_pb5_tmy_wdb .concept}

This article describes the guiding opinions on hierarchical evaluation project fees.

In accordance with the State Information Security Hierarchical Protection Rules, and in compliance with the relevant regulations and technical standards, the evaluation agencies conduct the hierarchical protection evaluation on the security status of information systems that do not involve state secrets.

In order to standardize the fees for hierarchical protection evaluation projects and establish a fair, equitable, orderly, and competitive market environment for evaluation, this document is formulated in accordance with the requirements of the Information Security Evaluation Alliance Convention.

The phrase "information system" in this document refers to the general information system.

## I. Fee formula {#section_sjn_vmy_wdb .section}

F = A x B

The fee \(F\) is derived from the base charge \(A\) and the adjustment factor \(B\). The fee is rounded to the nearest thousand.

## II. Base charge {#section_tjn_vmy_wdb .section}

The base charge is determined based on the requirements of hierarchical protection evaluation. It also reflects the value of penetration testing, risk assessment, and quantitative analysis. Additionally, in light of the increasing evaluation breadth and depth for level-3 and level-4 systems, the value of base charge increases. The guiding base charge \(rounded to the nearest ten thousand\) is calculated as follows:

Base charge \(A\) = Item fee \* the number of evaluation items

The calculation table for the base charge \(A\) of each province is different. Use Hierarchical Evaluation Project Base Charge Calculation Table for Each Province, Municipality, and Autonomous Region as a reference.

If the evaluation agency conducts evaluation outside of its registered province, the base charge is determined by the province in which the information system is registered.

## III. Adjustment factor {#section_ujn_vmy_wdb .section}

The adjustment factor \(B\) includes the following: System size \(B1\), multiple systems evaluation \(B2\), and repeated evalution \(B3\). These are factors that greatly influence the amount of evaluation work.

B=B1 x B2 x B3

1.  System size \(B1\): It is based on all system components included in the information system. The value of B1 is determined based on the number of servers that host the applications and data. In the case of server virtualization, the number is based on the number of virtual servers. Servers that host security and maintenance businesses \(for example, anti-virus servers and auditing servers\) do not add to the value of B1.

    The value of B1 is based on the number of servers:

    1.  Fewer than 5 servers: B1=0.8-0.9
    2.  6-19 servers: B1=0.9-1.0
    3.  20-49 servers: B1=1.0-1.2
    4.  50-100 servers: B1=1.2-1.5
    5.  100-200 servers: B1=1.5-2
    6.  More than 200 servers: B1≥2
    The number of servers can be obtained from the Information System Rating Report and Records. Additionally, the number should be obtained before the quote. For example, the number should be specified in the technical requirements of the bidding documents.

    The value of B1 based on pure network system: Level-2 B1=0.8, Level-3 B1=0.9, Level-4 B1=1.

2.  Multiple systems evaluation \(B2\): It is used to evaluate the multiple information systems that are on the same or different hierarchies within a single organization.

    The value of B2 is determined by the number of systems that are being evaluated at the same time.

    1.  2-5 systems: B2≥0.9
    2.  6-10 systems: B2≥0.8
    3.  11-50 systems: B2≥0.7
    4.  51-100 systems: B2≥0.5
    5.  More than 100 systems: B2≥0.3
3.  Repeated evaluation \(B3\): The evaluation fee decreases if the same agency re-evaluates the same information system that has not undergone major changes.

    The value of B3: ≥0.8.

    The initial evaluation fee assessed by the evaluation agency is the basis for repeated evaluation by the same agency.


Each agency determines the value of the adjustment factor based on the state of the information system being evaluated. Rules for determining the value of adjustment factor: the value of system size \(B1\), multiple systems evaluation \(B2\), and repeated evaluation \(B3\) must not be lower than the minimum value stated for each factor.
